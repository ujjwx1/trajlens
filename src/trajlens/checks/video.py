"""VIDEO checks (04_CHECK_CATALOG.md §VIDEO).

Only VIDEO.DECODABLE_SPOTCHECK is implemented in M4.
VIDEO.FRAME_COUNT_ALIGNMENT and VIDEO.RESOLUTION_FPS_MATCH are deferred to a
later milestone.

Security: per 06_SECURITY_AND_THREAT_MODEL.md T5, malformed media must not
crash or hang the process.  Every PyAV decode call is bounded by frame count
and wrapped in a try/except that emits FAIL naming the shard, never propagates
the exception.

This is the first place PyAV actually decodes anything in the codebase — M2/M3
only ever built handles.
