"""REPAIR.ORPHAN_SHARD_REPORT — fixer for STRUCTURAL.ORPHAN_SHARD.

Detection counterpart: src/trajlens/checks/structural.py _OrphanShardCheck,
which calls find_orphan_shards() directly (this module owns the detection
logic; the check is a thin wrapper).

Ground truth: the set of data/video shard paths every v3.0 episode record
resolves to, constructed the same way model/adapters.py's _V3Resolver builds
them (data/chunk-{n:03d}/file-{n:03d}.parquet,
videos/{camera}/chunk-{n:03d}/file-{n:03d}.mp4) — read directly from
meta/episodes/chunk-*/file-*.parquet rather than through
parquet_shard_for_episode()/video_segment_for_episode(), because those
handles do not expose the resolved path back out (pq.ParquetFile has no
filename attribute once opened; VideoShardHandle does, but there is no
symmetric parquet equivalent). Reading the raw locator columns keeps orphan
detection consistent with how STRUCTURAL.PATH_TEMPLATE_RESOLVES's forward
direction is reasoned about, without inventing a second path-resolution
scheme.

This is deliberately the safest fixer in the suite: it is a *report*, not a
silent auto-fix. Deletion is irreversible and permanently out of bounds
(08_ROADMAP.md's repair philosophy) — this module never deletes anything,
anywhere, under any option. apply() without quarantine=True moves nothing
and only reports; apply() with quarantine=True moves orphans to a sidecar
directory (<output>/.trajlens-quarantine/), never removes the source, and
writes a manifest of exactly what moved and why.

ADR-004 requirements satisfied here:
  - Copy-on-write: source is never opened in write mode; output_path
    receives the full copy, with orphans relocated within it.
  - Dry-run by default: dry_run() computes the Diff with zero filesystem
    writes, regardless of the quarantine option.
  - Round-trip: tests in tests/unit/test_orphan_shard_report.py and
    tests/property/test_orphan_shard_report_properties.py verify
    report -> quarantine -> re-lint -> shard no longer flagged.
