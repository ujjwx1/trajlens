"""REPAIR.VIDEO_METADATA_SYNC — fixer for VIDEO.RESOLUTION_FPS_MATCH.

Detection counterpart: src/trajlens/checks/video.py _DecodableSpotcheckCheck
(VIDEO.RESOLUTION_FPS_MATCH itself is catalog-only, not yet implemented as a
check; this fixer targets the invariant that check id names — LEROBOT.md §3
invariant 5 — using the same PyAV entry point (av.open()) DECODABLE_SPOTCHECK
already uses in-process).

Ground truth: the video container's own frame rate, read via PyAV
(``av.open(path).streams.video[0].average_rate``). The container is what the
decoder actually reads at train time, so a mismatch there is the real
corruption; the info.json declaration is what gets corrected.

Scope note (found during implementation, see PR body): 03_SPECS/LEROBOT.md's
verified info.json key set (DatasetInfo dataclass, lerobot 0.5.2) has exactly
one dataset-global ``fps`` field — there is no per-camera/per-feature fps and
no per-feature frame-count field. ``total_frames`` is a dataset-global
tabular row count, not a video-container-derived value, and does not
correspond 1:1 to any single video shard's frame count. This fixer therefore
only compares/corrects the single global ``fps`` field in info.json against
the video container's average_rate; frame-count is out of scope because no
declared field exists for it to correct. Re-muxing/re-encoding the video
itself is also out of scope — only info.json is ever rewritten.

ADR-004 requirements satisfied here:
  - Copy-on-write: source is never opened in write mode; output_path receives
    the corrected info.json.
  - Dry-run by default: dry_run() computes the Diff with zero filesystem writes.
  - Round-trip: tests in tests/repair/test_video_metadata_sync.py and
    tests/property/test_video_metadata_sync_properties.py verify
    repair → re-lint → no regression.

        info.json's fps field is declared int (sources/info.py
        DatasetInfoModel), matching the live lerobot DatasetInfo dataclass --
        it is not, and has never been, capable of holding a fractional value.
        A video container's average_rate can legitimately be a non-integer
        rational (e.g. 30000/1001 ~= 29.97 for NTSC drop-frame). Writing that

        whole number before it is ever compared or written -- the only value
        this field can actually hold -- so e.g. a container reporting 29.97
        against a declared 30 resolves as a no-op (nothing to fix: 30 is
        already the correct nearest integer), while a genuine 24-vs-30
