"""Fixer orchestration for `trajlens fix` (ADR-001, ADR-004).

This module is the library-level "which fixers apply, in what order, and how
do their copy-on-write outputs chain" logic.  The CLI (cli.py) is a thin
shell over run_dry_run()/run_apply(); no repair or selection logic lives
there, per ADR-001 (library-first).

Fixer selection: a fixer is "applicable" when its check_id appears in the
lint results at severity WARN or above -- the same threshold the fixers'
own round-trip tests already use to mean "this finding is present."

Composition order and the copy-chaining design (read before changing either):

Every Fixer.apply(ds, output_path) takes a CanonicalDataset bound to its own
source root and unconditionally copies that ENTIRE source tree to
output_path before rewriting its narrow slice (ADR-004 copy-on-write). There
is no "operate in place on an already-copied tree" mode in the Fixer
Protocol -- and there cannot safely be one without changing the protocol,
because apply() also refuses output_path == source root precisely so a
fixer can never be pointed at something that could be mistaken for the
original (see each fixer's "must not be the source dataset root" guard).

Given that contract, chaining N applicable fixers means N full tree copies,
each into its own temporary directory, with only the LAST fixer's output
landing at the user's requested --out:

    source --[fixer_1.apply]--> tmp_1 --[fixer_2.apply]--> tmp_2 --> ... --> out

Each tmp_i is reloaded as a fresh CanonicalDataset before being handed to the
next fixer -- a fixer only ever sees a CanonicalDataset whose declared
metadata matches the bytes actually on disk at that path, never a stale view
of a tree another fixer has since rewritten out from under it. This is the
only design consistent with the existing Fixer Protocol's guarantees; a
"one copy, rewrite in place" design would require changing apply()'s
signature or relaxing its source-root guard, which is a protocol change all
three fixers depend on, not a CLI detail (flagged in the PR, not made
silently).

Fixed fixer order -- episode_reindex, timestamp_dedrift, stats_recompute,
task_index_repair, video_metadata_sync, orphan_shard_report -- chosen
because stats_recompute streams data column values (including timestamp)
to recompute mean/std/min/max (checks/statistical.py
_stream_feature_columns), so it must run AFTER timestamp_dedrift or it
would compute "correct" statistics over still-wrong timestamps.
episode_reindex has no such dependency: _stream_feature_columns filters
rows by the row-level episode_index column directly, never by
dataset_from_index/dataset_to_index, so reindexing does not change what
stats_recompute streams. episode_reindex is placed first only because
"structural boundaries agree with data" is the more fundamental invariant to
restore first; timestamp_dedrift and episode_reindex have no dependency on
each other in either order.

task_index_repair (report-only: never rewrites task_index -- a dangling
reference has no principled automatic correction, see
task_index_repair.py's module docstring), video_metadata_sync (rewrites
meta/info.json's fps only), and orphan_shard_report (only ever moves
already-unreferenced files) are appended after the original three: none of
them read or write a column or field any other fixer touches, so they have
no ordering dependency on the first three or each other -- placed last
simply because they were added later, not because order matters for them.

Note: video_metadata_sync's target check, VIDEO.RESOLUTION_FPS_MATCH, is
not yet implemented (checks/video.py defers it to a later milestone), so
this fixer can never be selected automatically by select_applicable_fixers's
WARN+-in-results threshold -- it is only reachable via explicit --only
selection today. This is a known, pre-existing gap in the check suite, not
a bug in fixer selection.
